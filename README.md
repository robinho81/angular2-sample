# angular2-sample 
A repository containing a **very cut down** example of an angular2 project that uses webpack. 

The repository was created using the angular-cli and following the angular2 pages on webpack.

The purpose of this repository was to demonstrate some fundamental concepts when running angular2 and webpack. For the purposes of simplicity, I removed tests and end to end tests. I would **not recommend** running a real project without proper unit testing and end to end testing!
